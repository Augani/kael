# Full completion ledger

This ledger preserves the remaining scope of the performance/component review.
The goal is complete only after every requirement has current implementation
and runtime evidence at the scope described here. A compile check, a data-only
API, or a documentation update does not prove an interactive/GPU requirement.

The comparison target supplied by the user is [GPUI Kit](https://gpui-kit.com/).
Its published claims are comparison inputs; superiority requires matched runs.

| ID | Required final state | Authoritative proof | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | Public typed targets, portable fragment registration, reflected layouts/bindings, bounded pipeline/source/target storage, device ownership, budget-aware lifecycle | Public application example executes GPU pass and displays target without readback; malformed/layout/admission/lifetime tests; exact output pixels | Implemented with native examples and Metal/Blade GPU proof; platform completion remains |
| R2 | Native fragment parity on Metal, DirectX 11 and Blade, browser fragment path | Same effect/bindings on each real renderer; transparency, HDR, clipping, sampling and resize goldens | Metal/Blade/browser runtime proof; DX runtime CI pending |
| R3 | Native compute and GPU render-graph execution with declared imports, barriers/lifetimes, cache-key skipping and budget-pressure eviction | Real compute output and multi-pass DAG pixels; aliasing, stale input, cache, invalid imports and device-loss tests | Six shared graph fixtures pass on Metal and Blade; DX runtime pending |
| R4 | Matched product-shaped performance workloads, startup/interaction/idle/RSS/GPU/frame/churn measurements and environment metadata | Runnable same-contract Kael/GPUI Kit applications; raw repeated measurements; explicit power/wakeup capture and fair comparison gates | Ten navigation diagnostic runs complete; editor/data contracts compile; controlled runs, presentation/power and additional workflows remain |
| R5 | Built-in rendering parity for translucent effects, clips, gradients, text, resize and device loss | Pixel/runtime matrix on native Metal, DX11, Blade and browser engines; no silent skip treated as pass | Expanded GPU contracts pass locally; DX/Vulkan/GTK runtime and native populated-frame checks remain |
| R6 | Full logical accessibility for virtualized controls while viewport-only rendering remains | Offscreen-node or active-descendant semantics plus native assistive-technology exploration/actions; stable IDs/focus and large-model mounting tests | Open |
| R7 | Idle accessibility actions wake every native window correctly | Platform-thread/lifecycle/action-queue tests plus idle action execution on macOS, Windows and Linux AT adapters | macOS idle/protocol proof; Windows/Linux/GTK source and clients implemented, native CI pending |
| R8 | Unified memory policy for decoded images, pending work, completed default assets, scratch and atlases | Checked byte/count admission before expensive work; pressure shedding and retained-owner/cancellation tests on each backend | In progress |
| R9 | Reusable virtual filesystem explorer with cached sort keys, lazy async loading, context actions and drag/drop | Visible explorer example and UI-driven tests; bounded model/cache/pending state, generations/cancellation and stale-response tests | In progress |
| R10 | Persistent movable docking/tab groups, nested splits, floating panes and structured property inspectors | Runnable workspace; pointer/keyboard rearrangement, float/redock, persistence restore and editing/undo tests | In progress |
| R11 | Rich document and remote-data workflows build on current editors/grids | Real documents exercise selection, IME, undo/redo; remote-data editing/clipboard/frozen-pane/accessibility tests and sustained workloads | Open |
| R12 | Consumer docs, examples, capability truth and platform CI cover the finished APIs | Native/browser consumer builds, working examples, strict lints/docs, CI evidence and no outdated roadmap claims for implemented features | Open |

The shader design's later built-in-blur migration is a separate architecture
effort; it must not remove the existing visual correctness tests. Any scope
interpretation or blocked runtime requirement remains visible here instead of
being deleted from the review.

## Evidence tracks

- `2026-10-02-shader-completion.md`: GPU APIs, backends, pixels, ownership.
- `2026-10-02-memory-accessibility-completion.md`: admission, cancellation, pressure.
- `2026-10-02-components-completion.md`: filesystem and workspace interaction.
- `2026-10-02-gpui-kit-comparison.md`: pinned comparison and measured workloads.

The local combined checkpoint passed 3,010 library tests across core, UI, caches,
media engines and resource planning, including 442 UI tests. The later atlas
capacity-retry correction has its own required GPU regression. Native GPU helper
results and source scope are recorded in the evidence tracks above.

The matched comparison workflow builds both engines in both instrumentation
modes and preserves sixty navigation/editor/data runs. Implementing that workflow
does not constitute measured results. Native Windows/Linux clients and renderer
tests require actual CI execution. The Mac is currently locked, so fresh pointer,
IME, populated table pixels and drawable-presentation checks remain open.

R6 also retains explicit follow-up work: Linux disclosure/editable-text protocol
support, native text-range reveal routing and document geometry/word/hit testing.
These gaps are not removed by the passing macOS outline and Unicode protocol
fixtures. The goal remains active until the requirements and their evidence are
complete.
